# ELMO-8

## A Simple Game Library Inspired by the Excellent PICO-8

The goal of the library is to offer a small, simple game development environment which aspires to be as charming as [PICO-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

There are deliberate limitations to keep things simpler and to encourage the 8-bit aesthetic.

Aspirational specs:

- Display: 128x128 16 colours
- Sprites: 128 8x8 sprites
- Map: 128x32 cels
- Controls: 2 6-button joysticks

## Goals

- Be a nice little playground
- Be a simple teaching tool
- Be a nice way to write small games

## Using

Install from http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/micktwomey/elmo-8/latest

1. `elm package install micktwomey/elmo-8`
2. Edit Hello.elm
3. Download [examples/birdwatching.png](examples/birdwatching.png)
3. `elm reactor`
4. Go to http://localhost:8000/Hello.elm

Hello.elm:
```elm
import Elmo8.Console as Console
import Elmo8.Pico8 as Pico8

type alias Model = {}

draw : Model ->  List Console.Command
draw model =
    [ Console.putPixel 10 10 Pico8.peach
    , Console.print "Hello World" 10 50 Pico8.orange
    , Console.sprite 0 60 90
    ]

update : Model -> Model
update model = model

main =
    Console.boot
        { draw = draw
        , init = {}
        , update = update
        , spritesUrl = "birdwatching.png"
        }
```

The result should look like this:
